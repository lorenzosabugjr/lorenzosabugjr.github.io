_NOTICE: My new website is still under construction. I will add more sections in the coming months. Thanks for the patience!_

Hi, I'm Lorenzo! I want to welcome you to my academic website, and I hope you may find something interesting, or at least one that sparks a new idea for research. In case you found my expertise interesting, don't hesitate to reach out to me via e-mail or LinkedIn. I swear, I won't bite! :-D

My current research directions are in the intersection of **hybrid physics-/data-driven modelling**, and **predictive control**. In my current project I am building and investigating physics-informed machine learning techniques which are accurate and computationally fast. Furthermore, I will be investigating a new dual control approach that trades off between exploration and interaction with the environment. With the developed methods, I aim to make a breakthrough in the way we think about emergency response to large-scale environmental phenomena, like wildfires.

In my Ph.D. and subsequent research work, I was investigating novel **black-box optimisation techniques** and their **applications to industrial and aerospace** contexts. On this theme, I have published [some papers](/_publications/) and code (in my [GitHub](https://github.com/lorenzosabugjr/))! There are still some interesting directions (whether methodological or applications-oriented) I want to pursue regarding this, and I would be delighted to collaborate with you!
