In this paper, a robust nonlinear control scheme is proposed for voltage source converter based multiterminal HVDC grids, based on the predictive sliding mode control (PSMC). This control is a hybrid of the multivariable nonlinear model predictive control and sliding mode control. The particle swarm optimization method is applied to obtain the optimal control parameters. This control fulfills the objectives of regulating terminal dc voltage, active and reactive power, improved dynamic performance, and superior robust control operation even with plant parameter changes and external measurement disturbances. The performance of the proposed PSMC scheme is compared with the optimal synergetic control and optimal PI. The results confirm the superior transient performance and robustness of the PSMC scheme.
