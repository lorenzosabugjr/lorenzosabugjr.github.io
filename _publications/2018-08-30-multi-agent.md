This study proposes a novel control scheme for frequency support in multi-terminal dc grid-based hybrid ac/dc networks. This control is based on the multi-agent system paradigm with an adaptive frequency droop control and is distributed in all grid-tied converters. The objective of this control is to enable the ac grids to intelligently decide on their participation on frequency support, considering their power reserves, demand, and relevant technical constraints and requirements. The main achievement of the proposed control is to minimise the rate of change of frequency and frequency undershoot, and also providing a systematic enhancement in frequency stability, particularly in the disturbed and weak ac grids. A stability analysis is performed for the proposed control, using vector Lyapunov method for interconnected systems, deriving the conditions for stable operation. Test scenarios are conducted on a modified seven-terminal CIGRE grid, connecting five ac grids. Results under different scenarios show the performance and robustness of the proposed control in providing significant enhancement in the frequency regulation for the connected ac grids.
